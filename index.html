                A <b> <span> polymorphic virus </span> </b>is a type of computer virus that changes its code every time it spreads or infects a new system. 
                It does this to avoid being detected by antivirus software. Even though the virus keeps changing how it looks, 
                it still does the same harmful things, like stealing data, damaging files, or slowing down your device. 
            </p>

        <h3><span> How Does It Work?</span></h3>

        <p>
            Most antivirus programs look for known virus code, like a fingerprint.
            But a polymorphic virus keeps changing its code (or "appearance") every time it infects a new file or computer.
            This makes it hard for antivirus software to catch it because it doesn‚Äôt look the same every time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The virus uses a special engine called a <b><span> polymorphic engine</span></b>.
            This engine rewrites parts of the virus code each time it runs, but the virus still does the same job.

                                 This article from CrowdStrike explains in detail what a polymorphic virus is a type of malware that constantly changes its code to avoid being detected by antivirus software.
                                 It describes how these viruses use a polymorphic engine to rewrite parts of their code each time they spread, making traditional signature-based detection methods ineffective. 
                                 The article also highlights real-world examples such as the Storm Worm, which spread through fake news emails, and Beebone, a dangerous botnet that updated itself frequently to stay hidden from security systems. These examples show how polymorphic viruses can be both widespread and difficult to remove.

                        <p>
                            This article from Arctic Wolf explains how polymorphic viruses are able to evade detection by constantly changing their appearance.
                             It discusses how these viruses modify their code or encrypt themselves differently each time they infect a new system, which makes it very hard for antivirus programs to recognize and block them using traditional scanning methods. 
                             The article also lists well-known examples such as VirLock polymorphic ransomware that locks screens and infects files and CryptoWall, a ransomware variant that uses encryption and evasion techniques to hide from security tools. 
                             These examples highlight the evolving danger of polymorphic malware in both personal and business environments.

                        <p>
                            This article from BlackBerry provides a detailed technical breakdown of VirLock, a unique type of ransomware that not only encrypts files but also infects them with a polymorphic virus. 
                            It explains how VirLock uses polymorphic techniques to constantly change its code, making each infected file look different and harder for antivirus programs to detect. Unlike traditional ransomware, VirLock makes the infected files act as carriers, allowing the virus to spread more easily across systems and shared networks.
                             The article also discusses how VirLock disguises itself as legitimate software and uses screen-locking methods to demand ransom from victims. Its combination of file infection, code mutation, and ransomware tactics makes it especially dangerous and difficult to remove.

            <p>
                Learning about polymorphic viruses made me realize how dangerous and smart some computer threats can be. 
                These viruses are not like regular ones they keep changing their form every time they spread, which makes them very hard to detect. 
                I used to think antivirus software could catch all viruses, but now I know that some viruses, like polymorphic ones, are made to escape detection.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                One thing that stood out to me was how the virus can still do the same damage, even if its appearance keeps changing. 
                It can steal personal information, slow down your computer, or even lock your files. I also learned about examples like <span>Storm Worm</span> and <span>VirLock</span>,
                 which show how these viruses can spread quickly through emails or shared files. This made me realize how easy it is to get infected if we are not careful.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This topic taught me the importance of keeping my devices safe. I should always update my antivirus software and avoid opening unknown emails or files. 
                I also learned that backing up my data is important in case something bad happens. Overall, learning about polymorphic viruses opened my eyes to the world 
                of cybersecurity and why we need to protect our digital lives.
