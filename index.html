                A <b> <span> polymorphic virus </span> </b>is a type of computer virus that changes its code every time it spreads or infects a new system. 
                It does this to avoid being detected by antivirus software. Even though the virus keeps changing how it looks, 
                it still does the same harmful things, like stealing data, damaging files, or slowing down your device. 
            </p>

        <h3><span> How Does It Work?</span></h3>

        <p>
            Most antivirus programs look for known virus code, like a fingerprint.
            But a polymorphic virus keeps changing its code (or "appearance") every time it infects a new file or computer.
            This makes it hard for antivirus software to catch it because it doesn‚Äôt look the same every time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The virus uses a special engine called a <b><span> polymorphic engine</span></b>.
            This engine rewrites parts of the virus code each time it runs, but the virus still does the same job.

                                In 2024, Karnataka's cyber police faced a surge in polymorphic malware attacks, leading to financial losses of approximately ‚Çπ2,900 crore (about $350 million). These advanced viruses change their code frequently, making them difficult to detect with traditional antivirus software. The malware spread through phishing emails and malicious attachments, affecting both individuals and businesses. Authorities are now working to enhance cybersecurity measures to combat these evolving threats.

                            In March 2025, cybersecurity researchers uncovered a novel polymorphic malware that mimics legitimate browser extensions. This malware targets Chromium-based browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Brave, allowing attackers to steal user credentials and hijack accounts. By constantly altering its code, the malware evades detection, posing a significant threat to online security.

            <p>
                Learning about polymorphic viruses made me realize how dangerous and smart some computer threats can be. 
                These viruses are not like regular ones they keep changing their form every time they spread, which makes them very hard to detect. 
                I used to think antivirus software could catch all viruses, but now I know that some viruses, like polymorphic ones, are made to escape detection.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                One thing that stood out to me was how the virus can still do the same damage, even if its appearance keeps changing. 
                It can steal personal information, slow down your computer, or even lock your files. I also learned about examples like Storm Worm and VirLock,
                 which show how these viruses can spread quickly through emails or shared files. This made me realize how easy it is to get infected if we are not careful.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This topic taught me the importance of keeping my devices safe. I should always update my antivirus software and avoid opening unknown emails or files. 
                I also learned that backing up my data is important in case something bad happens. Overall, learning about polymorphic viruses opened my eyes to the world 
                of cybersecurity and why we need to protect our digital lives.

            <p> My name is Sheina Mae Villalon Labadan. I was born on October 29, 2003. I am currently studying at Gingoog City Colleges, taking up a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</br>
                I am not into sports, but I enjoy working with hardware, especially disassembling computers. I also like programming a little bit. It's fun, but sometimes it makes me feel crazy and stressed.</br>
                I started my primary education at Hindangon Elementary School, then moved to Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City. Later on, I transferred to Cebu City, where I finished my elementary education. </br>
                I moved there because my sister was living in Cebu. During that time, I also experienced being a working student.</br>
                <br>

                When I reached high school, I returned to Gingoog City. I first studied at Gingoog City Comprehensive National High School (GCCNHS), but later transferred to Bal-ason National High School, where I completed my Senior High School education. I feel lucky and grateful that I am now in college, continuing my journey. <br>
                I have three brothers and two sisters, and I am the second to the last child in the family. Sadly, I lost both of my parents when I was still a child. My father passed away due to an illness, and my mother committed suicide. Life has not been easy for me, but I do my best to study hard and finish my education. <br>
                I also try to earn money during my free time so I can support myself. My brother is the breadwinner of the family, and he is the one helping me with my tuition fees. <br>
                I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend because I want to stay focused on my studies. I know that relationships can sometimes be a distraction. I have big dreams in life. <br>
                Someday, after I finish college and get a stable job, I want to help my family. I plan to build our own house and buy my dream car. I want to reward myself and experience the life I‚Äôve always wanted. <br>
